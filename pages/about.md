The tech revolution is the central political challenge of our time. We believe that progressive politics can only meet it with new thinking and new coalitions. The best way to understand where we're coming from is to read our essay on [the new progressive agenda](https://progress.substack.com/p/the-new-progressive-agenda).

Our tech policy programme is part of the [Tony Blair Institute](https://institute.global).
